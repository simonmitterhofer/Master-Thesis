Almost two years have passed since I began my master's in Quantitative Finance, and about one year since this thesis topic was first suggested to me. My academic path started with a bachelor's degree in engineering and led me to this master's, a transition that was at times challenging but ultimately opened up new perspectives and opportunities. This thesis represents the completion of my master's studies and an important milestone in a journey that continues to unfold.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. RÃ¼diger Frey for suggesting this topic, for being an inspiring teacher, and for providing valuable guidance and feedback throughout the process.

I am deeply grateful to my parents, whose constant support has guided me through every decision and path I have taken. I would also like to thank my sister Mara, my brothers Maximilian, Alexander, Elias, and Lukas, and my cousins Armin, Manuel, and Jonas, whose encouragement and presence have made my life joyful and inspiring.

I am equally grateful to my friends from home, to those who accompanied me during my time in Vienna, and to those I got to know during these last two years, all of whom have made this journey memorable and fulfilling. The real alpha are the friends we made along the way.

This journey has been demanding yet rewarding, and I will carry both the knowledge and the memories I have gained as I move forward.
